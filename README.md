# Checkerboard Image Generation Task

This project involves generating a checkerboard image with smoothly changing colors, calculating its mean and standard deviation, drawing its histogram, and creating a warped version of the checkerboard. The implementation is done in Python using `numpy` for array operations and `matplotlib` for visualization.

## Task Description

The task consists of the following steps:

1. **Generate a Checkerboard Image**:
   - Create a checkerboard pattern with smoothly changing colors using sine functions.
   - The colors should transition smoothly across the image.

2. **Calculate Mean and Standard Deviation**:
   - Compute the mean and standard deviation of the pixel values in the generated image.

3. **Draw the Histogram**:
   - Plot the histogram of the pixel intensities in the image.

4. **Create a Warped Checkerboard**:
   - Apply a warp effect to the checkerboard image using sinusoidal transformations.

---

## Code Overview

The implementation is divided into the following functions:

1. **`generate_checkerboard`**:
   - Generates a checkerboard image with smoothly changing colors.
   - Uses sine functions to create smooth color gradients.

2. **`calculate_stats`**:
   - Computes the mean and standard deviation of the pixel values in the image.

3. **`draw_histogram`**:
   - Plots the histogram of the pixel intensities using `matplotlib`.

4. **`warp_checkerboard`**:
   - Applies a warp effect to the checkerboard image using sinusoidal transformations.

## Requirements

To run the code, you need the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

---

## How to Run the Code

1. Clone the repository or download the Python script.
2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed (see [Requirements](#requirements)).
3. Run the Python script:

```bash
python checkerboard_task.py
```

4. The script will:
   - Generate and display the checkerboard image.
   - Print the mean and standard deviation of the pixel values.
   - Display the histogram of the pixel intensities.
   - Generate and display the warped checkerboard image.

---

## Output

The script produces the following outputs:

1. **Checkerboard Image**:
   - A checkerboard pattern with smoothly changing colors.

2. **Mean and Standard Deviation**:
   - Printed in the console.

3. **Histogram**:
   - A plot showing the distribution of pixel intensities.

4. **Warped Checkerboard**:
   - A distorted version of the checkerboard image created using sinusoidal transformations.
